          first you learn the web development then go to any programming language.
          Most of the companies, Used the javascript as the main language.So if you
          have knolwedge of HTML and CSS then you really enjoy during learning of
          javascript.After learning the frontend part, you able to learn the backend
          part,Now pick up a language according your choice out of C++,JAVA or Python
          and used the same language for the data strutcture part.
          In parllel of learning,you'll need to make some project on that thecnologies
          that you works.If you do these things properly and with the decisplain.You really
          a good job between 3 to 4 months.
